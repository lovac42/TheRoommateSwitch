# Roommate Switch: Swap QA

## About:
This addon finds the oldest sibling that is either buried, suspended, or in new condition for the current card in the reviewer and places it in the queue to be reviewed next. The user can then grade, suspend or bury the current card and proceed to the sibling card for review. By doing so, we allow the siblings to keep it's own stats.
